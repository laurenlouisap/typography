Despite all the new savvy ways to stream online, when we want to see the new bond or marvel blockbuster we typically head to the cinema. 

Headed out to see the different typography on brand names on the cinemas dotted around Oxford. 

The one we all know and love: the Odeon. I don't think including an image is necessary as most could conjure up an image of what the typography looks like in their head. 

Curzon is a smaller chain of cinemas with the majority of them being located in London. However, this one can be found on the roof of Westgate shopping centre.

A hidden gem of Oxford entertainment, The Ultimate Picture Palace is tucked away down Cowley Road. 

Throwing a curveball is the Phoenix Picturehouse. Once an independent cinema, it is now part of a larger chain of Picturehouse cinemas owned by Cineworld.
