Kinetic typography- moving text. animation. 

**Star Wars**\
Are images even necessary here? Even someone who has never seen Star Wars could probably tell you what the opening is. The iconic yellow text crawls across the screen at an angle, disappearing into the universe behind it.

The font used is Franklin Gothic and it seems they have chosen for the width to be extended. This suits the film well as it creates a lot of space which is ideal since it is set in space itself.

The yellow colour stands out against the dark background whilst also matching perfectly as it resembles the colour of stars. 

The text is justified in the centre, helping it look visually appealing and easy for the audience to follow along.

**Catch Me If You Can**\
Before we get into it, if you haven't seen this film...what are you doing? It's a MUST. 

This has to be one of the best title sequences ever, it is perfect at keeping you engaged right from the very start. 

It uses two different typefaces: Coolvetica and Hellenic Wide. These contrast each other as Coolvetica is sans serif and a heavy weight with normal capitalisation whilst Hellenic Wide has serifs, is a light weight and is in all caps. This helps seperate names from roles and also creates some interest in the sequence.

The Coolvetica is the star of the show here, with many of the stems of the letters being extended and becoming part of the animation sequence. The characters interact with the letters, intergrating them into their storyline. For example, here the character creates a ladder from the stems of the letter 'M'.

This opening sequence is very interesting and uses typography in a unique and creative way.

**Grease**\
The opening to this film should never be skipped. 

Mostly this is a very cool animation

**Sherlock**\
Okay, okay we know this is a TV show but it simply cannot be ignored.

At various points in the show, Sherlock, enters his 'mind palace' where he visualises memories and facts, searching for a specific piece of information that may help him solve a case. The show utilises typography by having words appear on the screen with Sherlock sometimes interacting with them, swiping them away. 

This really helps the audience to understand his thought processes and
