Typography in movies has evolved over the years as movies are made at a more rapid pace and companies fight to get that blockbuster title. But what typefaces were in use in earlier cinema films?\
\
Back before we had such a thing as movies with sound, the 'talkies', audiences enjoyed silent movies. The typography in these were just as, if not more, crucial to the films. Letter cards were common in silent movies, and the focus was on communicating information to the audiences so typefaces had to be legible. 

You wouldn't want your movie ruined because you can't even read the text on the screen. 



As movies became more popular, they had to appeal to audiences and try and do something out of the ordinary so typeface was a major aspect of this.
