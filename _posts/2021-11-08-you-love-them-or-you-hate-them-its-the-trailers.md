While some may begrude the trailers that play before a film, in all the times I've been to the cinema I have never missed them. However, I'm certain there are far more adverts than trailers than there ever used to be, or is that just me?

On my recent cinema trips, I made sure to pay special attention to the typography used in the trailers.

**Spencer- watch the trailer here:** 

<div class="video-box"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20BIS4YxP5Q?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The trailer mostly sticks to one typeface throughout. creating a definitive feel for this film. What is that feeling you may ask? Elegance, class and quintessentially British.

The typeface is a serif font which somehow gives off an appearance of higher class. This could be because serif fonts have been around for much longer whereas sans serif fonts are, perhaps, more modern, dating back to 1805 (okay, maybe not modern like your iPhone but more modern than 3200 BC when it is believed us humans started writing). Being a light/regular weight, the typeface feels very fragile suggesting wealth and luxury. It is somewhat monospaced and high contrast, creating a lot of space and creating an air of elegance.

What do all these different impressions have in common? One might, on occassion, use such descriptions when discussing those of royal blood. In other words, the font is fancy like the Queen.

The quotes from reviews that are shown are much larger than the publications that they are from. Whilst it is important for the publisher/author of quote to be on the screen in order to give credibility for the audience, the actual quote is more significant as this is what should draw people to the film.

The title of the film is the same as other text was throughout the trailer but it stands alone when it appears, making it clear that this is the title. It draws a lot of attention as it is centered in the middle and, again, monospaced. 

'Directed by' and 'written by' is a smaller size than the names of these people, highlighting their significant roles in creating the film.

A screen of close together text is shown that is purely there to give credit to other companies and people who also had significant involvement in the film. Film buffs or anyone interested would not be able to necessarily read this whilst sat in a cinema but could certainly go away and pause this on their own devices were they to watch it on youtube or elsewhere.

Finally it shows the release date the text 'in theatres 11.5'. Again, it is centered, large and in the same typeface as throughout the film. It is the last part of the trailer and the text shown so if the audience go away remembering anything about 'the film about Diana' it would hopefully be 'I think it's out in November'.

**Spiderman- No Way Home:** 

<div class="video-box"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt-2cxAiPJk?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The first text shown in this trailer is in the film company logos (Sony, Columbia and Marvel Studios). 

Film company logos. Sony. Columbia. Marvel studios. All in capitals, heavy weight, block style lettering. Low contrast. Helps make it all very striking and bold and eye-catching just as superheros are. They stand out. All silver in colour/look metallic. This is normal for marvel and columbia but sony doesn't always look this way. Stylistic choice to fit in with the others for the trailer. Metallic choice- typical of action, futuristic, superhero genre films as it relates to lots of elements such as materials used in technology and cars and superhero outfits? 

Release date 'this christmas'. Centered. In same typeface used across promotion for this spiderman film. (differs from previous films) Different colours to previous/a lot darker. Signals a change to audience. Is this a new era/end of an era? Is this film going to be a lot darker in content? \
Capitalised letters. Border around letters a different colour. Creates a contrast- like the contrast between spiderman and peter parker. Heavy weight, low contrast. Sans-serif. Bold. Very rounded edges. Extended width. Extended width- futuristic? \
Title screen- 'spiderman' in same typeface as earlier.

'No way home' in a different typeface. Not all caps. Only initial letters of words are capitalised. Almost handwritten. Regular weight and contrast. Like spiderman may have written it. Represents his youth and being one of the more fun/lighthearted marvel films? O in 'home' replaced with a symbol spidermans head/mask/eyes. Slanted upwards- not perfect adds to this handwritten feel. E on home is capitalised. 

Official date at end. 'december 17' centered and in different typeface to the rest of the text on screen. In the same spiderman typeface. Represents it's importance and similar to 'spencer' helps to remember as it stands out.
