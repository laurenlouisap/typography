While some may begrude the trailers that play before a film, in all the times I've been to the cinema I have never missed them. However, I'm certain there are far more adverts than trailers than there ever used to be, or is that just me?

On my recent cinema trips, I made sure to pay special attention to the typography used in the trailers.

Spencer- watch the trailer here: 

<div class="video-box"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20BIS4YxP5Q?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Serif font. Monospaced? High contrast. Light/regular weight.

The quotes from reviews that are shown are much larger than the publications that they are from. Whilst it is important for the publisher/author of quote to be on the screen in order to give credibility for the audience, the actual quote is more significant as this is what should draw people to the film.

The title of the film is the same as other text was throughout the trailer but it stands alone when it appears, making it clear that this is the title. It is centered in the middle. Monospaced. 

'Directed by' and 'written by' is smaller than the names. 

Then a page of close together text that is purely there to give credit to other companies and people who had significant involvement in the film. Film buffs or anyone interested would not be able to necessarily read this whilst sat in a cinema but could certainly go away and pause this on their own devices were they to watch it on youtube or elsewhere.

Finally it shows the release date with the text 'in theatres 11.5' being shown on the screen. Again, it is centered, large and in the same font as throughout the film. It is the last part of the trailer and the last bit of text so if the audience go away remembering anything about 'the film about Diana' it would hopefully be 'I think it's out in November'
