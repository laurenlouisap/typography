While some may begrude the trailers that play before a film, in all the times I've been to the cinema I have never missed them. However, I'm certain there are far more adverts than trailers than there ever used to be, or is that just me?

On my recent cinema trips, I made sure to pay special attention to the typography used in the trailers.

Spencer- watch the trailer here:
