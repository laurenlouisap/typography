I don't think I ever watched the credits all the way through until I started watching Marvel films. Even then I can't say I have paid much attention to the typography as I'm more likely patiently waiting for those extra scenes. What is typography like in film credits- let's see.

It wasn't so easy to ignore the credits as once upon a time, they were at the beginning. You may have seen this in some older films such as \
Nowadays, these are at the end making it easy for you to just switch off the telly or leave the cinema (never do this in a Marvel film if you don't want to be judged greatly)

The 'fun' credits.

The 'serious' credits. You know, the black screen with the rolling credits, usually in white.
