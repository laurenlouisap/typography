I don't think I ever watched the credits all the way through until I started watching Marvel films. Even then I can't say I have paid much attention to the typography as I'm more likely patiently waiting for those extra scenes. What is typography like in film credits- let's see.

It wasn't so easy to ignore the credits as once upon a time, they were at the beginning. You may have seen this in some older films such as \
Nowadays, these are at the end making it easy for you to just switch off the telly or leave the cinema (never do this in a Marvel film if you don't want to be judged greatly)

The 'fun' credits. The typography here might be more exciting, possibly a custom typeface for that film or franchise. 

The 'serious' credits. You know, the black screen with the rolling credits, usually in white. This may be in a custom typeface for the film, but in most cases it a very simple font will be chosen to keep it legible and digestible. They tend to roll quite quickly so you may miss a lot of information unless you are to sit and pause the credits. Purpose is to give all crew, cast and anyone who was involved the recognition that they deserve and have worked so hard for.
