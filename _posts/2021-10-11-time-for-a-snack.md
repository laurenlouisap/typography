It just wouldn't be the cinema without some popcorn. Let's have a look at the typefaces that these brands are using on their packaging. 

Butterkist\
Very smooth. Handwritten? It somehow manages to look like butter. Or at least the texture. Like it would melt in the mouth. high x height ? High contrast. Outlined as well- stands out. Regular weight? Maybe heavy in some places. Somewhat condensed- letters are close together, flow from one another. 

Propercorn\
Two different typefaces. Reminds of the cinema or of typography you'd imagine in earlier movies. C hooks around the O. Corn is handwritten/script, maybe represent the unexpected nature of popcorn kernels when they pop. Corn- natural? 

Metcalfe's\
Seemed to have changed the typeface they use. Now capital letters, heavy weight, condensed. Again reminds of cinema and the signage of marquees. 

Joe and Seph's\
Two different typefaces. Represent the individuals behind the brand. Wouldn't assume popcorn but definitely does suggest some sort of confectionary as it is fun. One handwritten and high contrast. One all caps, low contrast. Sort of suggests they are a serious business but are creative with their products (flavours)
