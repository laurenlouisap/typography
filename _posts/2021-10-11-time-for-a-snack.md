It just wouldn't be the cinema without some popcorn. Let's have a look at the typefaces that the big UK brands are using on their packaging. 

Butterkist\
They boast about being the 'Nation's favourite popcorn' and judging from their unique typeface, it is clear why.\
Being high contrast, varying weights and sizes, this fun and bold typeface perfectly reflects the fun nature of popcorn. The company themselves have stated that the typeface is intended to represent 'the moving of the popping corn' (<https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/13-19-february-2017/butterkist/>). \
I don't know about anyone else but the typeface somehow manages to look smooth like butter with the curved edges and tails, flowing seamlessly into each other. 

Propercorn\
The typeface used for 'proper' is heavy weight, low contrast, a somewhat condensed width and in all caps. It feels not so dissimilar to typefaces seen on cinema branding. On the opposite end, the typeface for 'corn' is handwritten, light weight, high contrast and only the initial letter 'C' is capitalised. It feels fun and creative with the letter 'C' even hooking onto the letter 'O' in 'proper'. This contrast is unexpected, just like the unexpected nature of popping kernels. 

Metcalfe's\
Though the heavy weight makes it bold, simplicity is key here. It is easy to read and gets the job done. It is almost popcorn for adults as it so boldly displays the calories of the product. \
Sans serif though most other aspects of the packaging are serif fonts. 

Joe and Seph's\
Two different typefaces. Represent the individuals behind the brand. Wouldn't assume popcorn but definitely does suggest some sort of confectionary as it is fun. One handwritten and high contrast. One all caps, low contrast. Sort of suggests they are a serious business but are creative with their products (flavours)
