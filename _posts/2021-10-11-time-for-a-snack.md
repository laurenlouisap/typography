It just wouldn't be the cinema without some popcorn. Let's have a look at the typefaces that the big UK brands are using on their packaging. 

Butterkist

They boast about being the 'Nation's favourite popcorn' and judging from their unique typeface, it is clear why.\
Being high contrast, varying weights and sizes, this typeface works seamlessly at being the spearhead of a popcorn company with its fun tone and personality. The company themselves have stated that the typeface is intended to represent 'the moving of the popping corn' (<https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/13-19-february-2017/butterkist/>). \
The curved aspects \
 \
Very smooth. Handwritten? It somehow manages to look like butter. Or at least the texture. Like it would melt in the mouth. high x height ? High contrast. Outlined as well- stands out. Regular weight? Maybe heavy in some places. Somewhat condensed- letters are close together, flow from one another.

Along with the main colour being a slightly off white and the two other shades of brown. 



Propercorn\
Two different typefaces. Reminds of the cinema or of typography you'd imagine in earlier movies. C hooks around the O. Corn is handwritten/script, maybe represent the unexpected nature of popcorn kernels when they pop. Corn- natural? 

Metcalfe's\
capital letters, heavy weight, condensed. Again reminds of cinema and the signage of marquees. Very bold. Sans serif though most other aspects of the packaging are serif fonts. 

Joe and Seph's\
Two different typefaces. Represent the individuals behind the brand. Wouldn't assume popcorn but definitely does suggest some sort of confectionary as it is fun. One handwritten and high contrast. One all caps, low contrast. Sort of suggests they are a serious business but are creative with their products (flavours)
