This blog will cover all things typography in cinema. From the cinemas themselves to popcorn brands, it will look at different typefaces used and the meanings they allude. 

There are no crazy scientific explanations to most of these ramblings, just opinions and ideas. But feel free to agree or disagree whenever you please.
