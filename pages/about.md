This blog will cover all things typography in cinema. Typefaces may be the last thing we think we pay any attention to when watching our favourite films, but they can totally change our viewing experience. From the cinemas themselves to your favourite popcorn brand, this site aims to look at and explore different typefaces used and the meanings they may allude.

The site name, 'type in the talkies' was created as it was important to include both the typography aspect as well as the theme of cinema. The alliteration of the title makes it fun and engaging with the word 'talkies', referring to films with sound, also adding to this. Although the site is about more than just films (or 'talkies'), the title seems to work well in suggesting its content and purposes.

Designed in Adobe Illustrator, the logo for this site is a simple film reel with the letter 't' encorporated into the logo. This accurately represents the site with the design very obviously linking to cinema and film and the letter standing for 'type' but also 'talkies'. The colours are simple, grey and black, in order to accurately resemble a traditional film reel. The logo is composed of many different circles enabling the letter 'T' to stand out in the centre. The typeface choice for this letter, Futura, is sans serif and a regular weight, ensuring its legibility and is the same one used on the banner for the site, ensuring coherency across the site.

Another Illustrator creation, the banner chosen is a design of the typical marquee signs that can be found on most theatres today but were more common on older cinemas and venues. The bright colours and patterns are engaging without being too confusing to look at. The text has been carefully sized so that the largest is of the site title, 'type in the talkies' with a subheading briefly stating the purpose underneath. The typeface used for these texts, Futura, is similar to those that would be found on marquee signs being sans serif, condensed and heavy weight. The grey background color was chosen as it is the same as the one used on the logo, helping the site look visually consistent.
